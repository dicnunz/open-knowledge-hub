# Support Open Knowledge Hub

**Open Knowledge Hub** is a volunteer‑run project dedicated to building a free, open, and verifiably sourced repository of human knowledge and skills for everyone, everywhere.

We will soon launch an **Open Collective** page to provide transparent, community‑funded support for hosting and other operational costs. If you’d like to contribute, please check back here or follow our roadmap for updates.
