title: "The Scientific Method"
summary: "The scientific method is a systematic, evidence‑based process for building reliable knowledge. By cycling through observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and analysis, scientists minimize bias and produce results that can be independently verified."

# The Scientific Method

## 1. Core Concept (The Big Idea)
Imagine science as a detective story: observations are clues, a hypothesis is the prime suspect, and experiments are interrogations that either confirm or refute the suspect’s alibi. The scientific method is the repeatable procedure that guides this investigation, ensuring conclusions rest on evidence rather than guesswork.

## 2. Key Components & How It Works
* **Observation & Question:** Notice a phenomenon and frame a clear, testable question.  
* **Hypothesis:** Propose a tentative explanation that can be falsified.  
* **Experimentation:** Design controlled tests that isolate variables and collect measurable data (NASA Space Place, 2023).  
* **Analysis:** Evaluate the data to see whether it supports or contradicts the hypothesis.  
* **Conclusion & Communication:** Draw conclusions and share results so others can replicate the work.

## 3. Verifiable Claims & Evidence
* **Claim:** A hypothesis must be falsifiable to be considered scientific.  
  * **Source:** Karl Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery*, 1959, ISBN 978‑1138125566.  
* **Claim:** Scientific progress often occurs through “paradigm shifts” rather than gradual accumulation.  
  * **Source:** Thomas S. Kuhn, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, 2nd ed., 1970, ISBN 978‑0226458045.

## 4. Different Perspectives & Criticisms
* **Karl Popper (Critical Rationalism):** Emphasizes falsifiability; a single contradictory result should prompt theory revision.  
* **Thomas Kuhn (Historicism):** Argues that normal science operates within paradigms until anomalies trigger a revolutionary shift.  
* **Paul Feyerabend (Epistemological Anarchism):** Claims no single method fits all scientific discovery, warning against rigid methodological rules.
