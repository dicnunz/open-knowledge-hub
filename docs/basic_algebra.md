# Basic Algebra

## 1. Core Concept (The Big Idea)
Think of algebra as a **balance scale**: whatever you do to one side of an equation, you must do to the other to keep it level. By replacing numbers with symbols, algebra lets us describe patterns and solve problems where some values are unknown.

## 2. Key Components & How It Works
* **Variables:** Symbols (like *x* or *y*) that stand in for numbers.  
* **Constants & Coefficients:** Fixed numbers and the multipliers of variables.  
* **Operations & Properties:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, along with properties such as commutativity (a + b = b + a) and distributivity (a(b + c) = ab + ac) (MIT OCW, 2024).  
* **Equations:** Statements that two expressions are equal; solving means finding all variable values that satisfy the equality.  
* **Functions:** Rules that assign each input exactly one output, often written *f(x)*.

## 3. Verifiable Claims & Evidence
* **Claim:** The commutative property of addition holds for real numbers: a + b = b + a.  
  * **Source:** MIT OpenCourseWare, *Algebra I*, Lecture 1 Notes, 2024.  
* **Claim:** Solving a linear equation requires applying inverse operations to isolate the variable.

## 4. Different Perspectives & Criticisms
* **Historical Development:** Algebra evolved from arithmetic problem‑solving in Babylonian mathematics to symbolic manipulation in the Islamic Golden Age (al‑Khwarizmi). Some educators debate how early students should transition from arithmetic to abstract symbols, arguing for more contextual, real‑world problems to maintain engagement.
